# This script is used for setting up and deploying smart contracts to the Soroban network.
# It should be run from the project root directory.
#
# Usage:
# bash /path_to_script/deploy_contracts.sh <network> <n_tokens> <run_setup>
#
# <network>: Name of the Soroban network to connect to.
# <n_tokens>: The number of tokens (this argument is not used in the script but kept for compatibility).
# <run_setup>: Set to "false" to skip running the setup script, any other value will run setup.
#
# Example:
# bash /path_to_script/deploy_contracts.sh standalone 5 false
#
# Dependencies:
# - soroban: Make sure the 'soroban' CLI tool is available.
# - make: Ensure that 'make' is available for building contracts.

# Enable the 'exit immediately' shell option
set -e

# Accept command-line arguments
